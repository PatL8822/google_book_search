## Description

Learning MEARN stack was a challenge for me. I wanted to test myself in refactoring
RESTful API code to GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.The application is a wonderful way to track books you want to read. The biggest part I learned in this refactoring project was to make sure all your code is up to date in package.json files. Also to really fine tooth comb over the existing code to make sure you're not changing current/relative information needed for the project. The other hardest part for me was to keep in mind all the pathing work needed between the client and server.
